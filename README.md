# Geiger-Counter
Arduino Geiger counter with LCD screen

Coded for using the LCD 1602 module.

The RH electronics Geiger counter kit was used but any Geiger counter with an output for pulses will work. 
If you use a Geiger–Müller tube other than the Soviet SBM-20 you will need to change the conversion factor.
